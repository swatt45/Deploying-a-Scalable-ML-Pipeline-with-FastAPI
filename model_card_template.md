## Training Data

## Evaluation Data

## Metrics
Measures used to score this model's perfomance and results:

* Precision - What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?
    $$True positives / (True positives + False positives)$$
* Recall - What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?
    $$True positives / (True positives + False negatives)$$
* F1 - $F\beta$ scorer with beta equal to 1.
    $$F1 = ((1+\beta^2) * precision * recall) / \beta^2 * precision + recall$$
